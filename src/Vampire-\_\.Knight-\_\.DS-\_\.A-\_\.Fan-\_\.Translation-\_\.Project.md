# Vampire Knight DS: A Fan Translation Project
 
Vampire Knight DS is a dating sim game based on the popular anime/manga series Vampire Knight, which follows the story of Yuki Cross, a guardian of the Cross Academy, a school where humans and vampires coexist. The game was released in Japan in 2009 by D3 Publisher, but it never got an official English localization. However, thanks to a dedicated fan translation team, English-speaking fans can now enjoy this game on their Nintendo DS consoles or emulators.

The fan translation project was started by Anime Game Translations Team, a group of volunteers who love anime and games. They spent over a year working on translating the game's text and images, as well as hacking the ROM to make it compatible with English. The project was completed and released on December 3rd, 2021, and it is available for download on their website[^1^] or on Romhacking.net[^2^]. The patch is in xDelta format, and it can be applied to a clean Japanese ROM of the game using Delta Patcher or online ROM patcher. The patch also includes a secondary compatibility patch for bad dumps of the ROM.
 
The game features an original story that takes place in the world of Vampire Knight, where Yuki Cross has to balance her duties as a guardian of the school and her relationships with the mysterious Night Class students, who are actually vampires. The game has multiple endings depending on Yuki's choices and interactions with the characters. The game also has mini-games, such as patrolling the school grounds, dressing up Yuki, and taking quizzes. The game has voice acting for all the main characters, as well as some original songs.
 
The fan translation team hopes that their work will bring joy to Vampire Knight fans who have been waiting for a chance to play this game in English. They also hope that their project will inspire more fan translations of other anime-based games that have not been localized. They welcome feedback and bug reports from players who try their patch.

The fan translation of Vampire Knight DS is not the only one that deserves attention. There are many other anime-based games that have not been officially localized, but have been translated by passionate fans who want to share their love for these titles.
